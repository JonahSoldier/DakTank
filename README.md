# JakTank
### The Valen Sandbox/DakTank Warzone fork of DakTank

[DakTank](https://github.com/Dakota0001/DakTank) is an addon focused around tank building. It makes building substantially faster and easier than in ACF, while having more in-depth armouring, penetration, and cost systems.

JakTank is a continuation of DakTank's development, including massive performance improvements, bug fixes, and general improvements to how certain systems (e.g. AutoTread) function.

Balance between the two versions is relatively un-changed. Switching from DakTank to this version shouldn't break any of your existing designs.
